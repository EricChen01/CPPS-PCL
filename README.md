## Introduction

This PCL contains an API, alongside two CLI interactive modes:

### 1. Single-Login

A simple login with one penguin.

### 2. Multi-Login

A complex login with multiple penguins managed by a certain shape.

## Requirements
* Python 2.x
* Internet connection
* _For Club Penguin Rewritten_: [cefpython](https://github.com/cztomczak/cefpython) (can be installed with: `pip install cefpython3`)
* _For Club Penguin Online_: [PyCrypto](https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/) (can be installed with: `pip install pycrypto`, and [here](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pycrypto) for Windows)

## FAQ

### I double-clicked `login.py` and a command prompt appeared and then closed, what should I do?
* If the command prompt appeared for a moment and then closed, then you are probably running `login.py` with Python 3. Consider installing Python 2, or if you have already installed it, right-click `login.py` and open it with Python 2 using the "Open With..." option.
* If the command prompt closed after taking user input, then an unexpected error occured during the login process. Try running it again in `cmd.exe` in order to see what happened, and if it looks like a problem, please [open an issue](https://github.com/relrelb/CPPS-PCL/issues/new) regarding it.

### Can I add all items?
Sure, you can accomplish that by writing a custom script using the [API](#api). An example can be found in the answer at [Issue #3](https://github.com/relrelb/CPPS-PCL/issues/3#issuecomment-345218486).

### Can I login to a CPPS that is not listed above?
Absolutely, you can add more CPPSs yourself by editing [`json/servers.json`](https://github.com/relrelb/CPPS-PCL/blob/master/json/servers.json).

### Can I add more shapes to Multi-Login?
Of course, you can define more shapes by editing [`json/shapes.json`](https://github.com/relrelb/CPPS-PCL/blob/master/json/shapes.json).

### Is autocompletion also available in Windows?
Yes, in order to get that you need [PyReadline](https://pypi.org/project/pyreadline/) (can be installed with:  `pip install pyreadline`).
